# Baby-Lifi

During that project in the context of study in Polytechnical Faculty of Mons, we create an application who permits to send data from a Smartphone to another by the torch light of the phone. 

The application has been developped on Android Studio. Concretly the mobile phone is able to send short message (like word). The works is done in several steps : 
- Entry of the word in the Phone 1 
- Conversion of it in binary thanks to ASCII table 
- Emission of the word by the Phone 1 ('1' means light on during a certain time, '0' light off)
- Receveiment of the message by the Phone 2 (and conversion of light on during a certaine time in a '1', ...)
- Reconversion of the word from binary
- Message directly put on the screen

The application has been developped by DELVIGNE Victor & PONSART Chloé with the help of Mr. Bette & Mr. Van Laere.
